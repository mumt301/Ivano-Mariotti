  <h3>Who am I?</h3>

    <p>My name is Ivano Mariotti, a 22 year old with
    a passion for learning and creating all things
    art, music and media.</p>

  <h3>What do I study?</h3>

    <p>I study music at the Schulich School of Music. I am in faculty of arts
    department with a concentration in jazz drums. I am also in the MAT minors.</p>

  <h3>What kind of Music do you like?</h3>

    <p>I dont have a preference, I welcome all styles of music in my library. I tend
    to phase in and out between genres over a period of time. Currently as of this semester
  I have been indulging in a lot of <i>90s/early 2000s rap, 50s/60s rock</i> and any new albums
that come out from major or smaller artists in any genres, such as <i>Dawn FM</i>, <i>Harry's House</i> or
<i>Everything I know about love</i> by Laufey.</p>

  <h3>Hobby's of Mine</h3>

    <p>Besides the obvious one being music/performing, I have a keen interest in physical activity.
    Over the summer I played lots of different sports, in or out of leagues such as futbol (soccer),
  voleyball, swimming and tennis. I have also been attending a gym for the past year and a half consistently,
roughly 3 to 4 days a week depending on my schedule. Another hobby of mine, in cordination with physical
activity is cooking. My father is a chef and has taught me many beautiful dishes that I love to cook and eat,
such as pastas, meats, soups ect.. With these acquired skills, I was able to make proper use of them through
my exercising, since diet really is the most important part of leading a healthy lifestyle in my opinion. </p>
